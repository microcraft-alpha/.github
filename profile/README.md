`Microcraft` is simply a pack of microservices running on top of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), but with slightly different stacks. It's neither something fancy or complex. Main goal for me was to get more familiar with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and how it can be implemented in a microservice architecture. Also, I wanted to try Event-Driven Architecture with my own implementation. In the meantime, I was interested in trying out `FastAPI` with different technologies included, like `Beanie`, `SQLAlchemy` or `Strawberry`. Eventually, I was striving to have something fairly simple, so I can use it while learning stuff like `Kubernetes` later on.

I hope you can find something interesting in any of those projects. As I mentioned, they are using slightly different technologies, so the code is quite different. I think the best work in terms of DDD (abstractions, patterns, etc.) was done in the `Oak Signs` project (obviously the last one!), but if you need something technology-specific, you can check the other ones as well.
